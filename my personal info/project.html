    <h3>Greetings,</h3>
    <br>
    <p id="e" class="ed">This is Syed Askari Abbas a passionate student and an aspiring computer scientist. 
        Since I have a very curious mind, I opted for Science subjects in my O and A levels. All these years of learning made me able to strengthen my knowledge base around subjects like mathematics, physics, and computer sciences.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="d" class="de">My fascination with technology was sparked when, as a child I thought it would be a great idea to take apart my Playstation console. Aware of the danger, I was still eager to see how it all worked inside. I find it intriguing how fast society has been shaped and continues to be, by the influence of Computer Science</p>
    <br>
    <p id="g" class="go">I have several goals in my life, but the most vital one is to become a programmer. This is because a programmer can do wonders, they have the skill and power to influence and construct digital spaces. Although ,I understand that computer science is not just about programming and hardware but also about the ethics entailed in the process of a design as well as innovative thinking</p>
    <br>
    <p id="f" class="fu">Technological advancements take place around us everyday, from the evolution of bulky antenna phones into smart phones to the introduction of smart virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Google Now and Windows’ Cortana. I am inspired by the fact that computer science has become a fundamental element in the development of a better, smarter future for our world and my goal is to be part of that development process. </p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="pj">Thank you very much.</h4>
